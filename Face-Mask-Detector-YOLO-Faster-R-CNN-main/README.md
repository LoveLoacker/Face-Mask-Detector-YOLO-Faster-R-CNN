# Face-Mask-Detector-YOLO---Faster-R-CNN

CS-334 Final Project. All images are found in "Images" and corresponding annotations in "Labels". The YOLO model's separate image/annotations are found in "YOLOv8". The project was developed in Google Collab using V100 GPU for runtime. Both Python notebook and Python file contain the same code. Screenshots of results and metrics are found in the respective results folder for each model. NOTE that all these folders were 
located in my google drive and the code was developed in google colab notebooks, so we had to manually download and upload everything in this repository, hence the number of commits.
